A Data-Driven Approach to Purchase Order Follow-Up
In today’s supply chains, procurement delays can mean more than just lost sales—they can disrupt overall supply chain service levels, customer satisfaction and many more. With thousands of items, inconsistent vendor response times, and siloed inventory systems, how can procurement teams prioritize their follow-ups efficiently?

In this article, I walk you through a real-world notebook that builds an intelligent purchase follow-up priority engine using supply chain principles like ABC classification, Days of Inventory (DOI), and frequency of movement status.
